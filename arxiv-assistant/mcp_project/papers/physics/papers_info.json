    "summary": "In this paper, it is argued that theoretical physics is more akin to an\norganism than to a rigid structure.It is in this sense that the epithet,\n\"sick\", applies to it. It is argued that classical physics is a model of a\nhealthy science, and the degree of sickness of modern physics is measured\naccordingly. The malady is located in the relationship between mathematics and\nphysical meaning in physical theory.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we argue that there are foundational dilemmas in theoretical\nphysics related to the concept of reality and the nature of mathematics in\nphysics. Physical theory is treated as a conceptual organism which develops\nunder the weight of its internal contradictions. The paper discusses in depth\nthe problem of objective reality in physics and its relation to scientific\npractice. Then, it explores the problematic relation between physical meaning\nand mathematics in modern physical theory, followed by a discussion of the\ntrend of contemporary physics to replace physical principles with pure\nmathematical principles. Finally, it discusses the problem of logical coherence\nin modern physical theory. The paper emphasizes the importance of resolving\nthese dilemmas to the proper practice of theoretical physics.",
